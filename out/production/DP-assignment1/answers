Q: What happens if the designers of the Storage class decide to change the implementation of the List to LinkedList?
-Think about the method calls in main - does trimToSize() exist in LinkedList?
-Should Main know about what concrete type of List Storage provides?

A: trimToSize() is not a method call available on LinkedList. so it wouldn't work.
Main should not depend on the concrete type of list you want instead it should depend only on
the interface List<>.
